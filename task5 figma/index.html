                    <h1>Creates space from <br>your phone</h1>
                    <p> Unlike other solutions designed to reduce screen time, 
                        the Aro platform combines an app and a physical device 
                        to create distance between 
                        you and your phone so you can have quality time without 
                        the distraction of your phone.

                    <p>We live in a gamified world - badges, streaks, achievements, 
                        and filling in that daily ring. Aro gives you credit for 
                        the time you spend engaged in real life because the reward
                         builds the habit of putting down your phone.

                        completely locking it away are not practical solutions.
                         We need our phones...but
                         maybe not at the dinner table or during a conversation.
                          We designed Aro to fit in your everyday rhythms.
